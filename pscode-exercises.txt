// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
check if the remainder number is divided by 2 is equal to 0
if true, then number is even.
if false, then number is odd.
if number is even print on the screen "the number is even", if number is odd print "the number is odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) ask for a 5 numbers
b) add 5 numbers together and divide sum by 5
c) set first given number as a initial number
compare initial number with next number, if next number larger than initial update initial
repeat this step for the remaining numbers
compare initial number with next number, if next number smaller than initial update initial
repeat this step for the remaining numbers
d) print on the screen the result of division by 5
print on the screen the largest number
print on the screen the smallest number
